This is a small collection of popular sorting algorithms. The current version

  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands:

    -Bubble/bubble/bubblesort
  
    -Insert/insert/insertionsort
  
    -Select/select/selectionsort
  
    -Merge/merge/mergesort
  
    -Bogo/bogo/bogosort

    -All -> uses every algorithm on the dataset
    
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
