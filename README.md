# Sorting-Algorithm-Collection

This is a small collection of popular sorting algorithms. The current version
includes : Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Bogo Sort.
Upon starting the program, it will ask you:

<b> "Enter a dataset:" </b>

    Enter your dataset of integers (separate your integers with spaces)

<b>"What Algorithm?: </b>
  
  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands (upper/lower-case doesn't matter):

    -bubble/1
  
    -insert/2
  
    -select/3
  
    -merge/4
  
    -quick/5

    -radix/6 (only for positive integers atm)
    
    -bogo/7
    
    -ninput -> enter new dataset or generate one
    
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
