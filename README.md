# Sorting-Algorithm-Collection

This is a small collection of popular sorting algorithms. The current version
includes : Bubblesort, Insertionsort, Selectionsort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Radix LSD (Base 10)
and Bogosort.
Upon starting the program, it will ask you:

<b> "Enter a dataset:" </b>

    Enter your dataset of integers (separate your integers with spaces)

<b>"What Algorithm?: </b>
  
  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands (upper/lower-case doesn't matter):

    -Bubblesort -> bubble or 1
  
    -Selectionsort -> select or 2
  
    -Insertionsort -> insert or 3
  
    -Mergesort -> merge or 4
  
    -Quicksort -> quick or 5

    -Radix LSD (Base 10) -> radix or 6 (only for positive integers atm)
    
    -Bogosort -> bogo or 7
    
    -ninput -> enter new dataset or generate one
    
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
