<b>"What Algorithm?: </b>
  
  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands (upper/lower-case doesn't matter):

    -bubble/bubblesort
  
    -insert/insertionsort
  
    -select/selectionsort
  
    -merge/mergesort
  
    -quick/quicksort

    -bogo/bogosort
    
    -radix
    
    -ninput -> enter new dataset or generate one
    
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
