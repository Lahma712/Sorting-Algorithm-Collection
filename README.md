# Sorting-Algorithm-Collection

This is a small collection of popular sorting algorithms. The current version
includes : Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Bogo Sort.
Upon starting the program, it will ask you:

<b> "Please enter a dataset:" </b>

    Eter your dataset of integers (separate your integers with spaces)

<b>"What Algorithm?: </b>
  
  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands:

    -Bubble/bubble/bubblesort
  
    -Insert/insert/insertionsort
  
    -Select/select/selectionsort
  
    -Merge/merge/mergesort
  
    -Bogo/bogo/bogosort

    -All -> uses every algorithm on the dataset
    -ninput -> lets you enter a new dataset
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
