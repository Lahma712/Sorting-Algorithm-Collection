# Sorting-Algorithm-Collection

This is a small collection of popular sorting algorithms. The current version
includes : <b>Bubblesort, Insertionsort, Selectionsort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Radix LSD (Base 10)
and Bogosort.</b>
Upon starting the program, it will ask you:

    Generate dataset or enter your own?(1/2):


<b>If you enter "1":</b>

    Enter length of dataset:

  F.ex: 1000 (dataset consists of 1000 integers)
   
    Enter boundaries('min int'-'max int'):

  F.ex: 0-200 (puts integers from 0 to 200 into the dataset)

<b>If you enter "2"</b>

    Enter your dataset:

  Enter a list of integers (separate integers with spaces)

    What Algorithm?:
  
  Chose one of the algorithms listed above with the following commands (upper/lower-case doesn't matter):

    -Bubblesort -> bubble
  
    -Selectionsort -> select
  
    -Insertionsort -> insert
  
    -Mergesort -> merge
  
    -Quicksort -> quick

    -Radix LSD (Base 10) -> radix (only for positive integers atm)
    
    -Bogosort -> bogo
    
    -ninput -> enter new dataset or generate one
    
    
  The output will display the sorted dataset aswell as how much time it took to sort it (in seconds).
